Hi friends.

Want to learn to develop for wen. Overwhelming amount of new concepts, techniques, and technologies. Having fun diving from the deep end of the pool. 

Starting out with Django, and some HTML, CSS, and a little vanilla Javascript. Have some previous knowledge in Python and C. 

Built a small homepage (under active development) at
